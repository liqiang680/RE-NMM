# RE-NMM

This code is about the neural mass model RE-NMM, which is applied to simulate spike discharges and the competitive dynamics observed between spikes and spindles in Rolandic epilepsy (RE).

We also refer the code of Costa2016_model. % M. S. Costa and A. Weigenand, et al. "A thalamocortical neural mass model of the eeg during nrem sleep and its response to auditory stimulation." PLOS Computational Biology, vol.12, no.9, 2016.
